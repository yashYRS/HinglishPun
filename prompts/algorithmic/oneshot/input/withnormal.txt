Construct a code mixed Hindi English pun based on the instructions given.
Steps 
1. Create a triplet of a English word "EN", a Hindi word "HI" that is a homophone to the English word and the translation of the Hindi word in English "HI_TO_EN".
2. If "HI_TO_EN" and "EN" are the same, redo step 1, else proceed to step 3.
3. Make short sentences (less than 10 words), with "EN" as the object of the sentence.
4. Replace "EN" with the "HI"
5. Replace the Noun Phrase at the start of the sentence with a contextualised phrase that is highly related to the "HI_TO_EN" word.

An example is given below
"""
Step 1:
EN: "dude"
HI: "दूध" (pronounced as "doodh")
HI_TO_EN: "milk"

Step 2: 
"milk" and "dude" are not the same, proceed to Step 3

Step 3:
Short sentence with "EN" as the object: "Korbin asked - `Whats up dude ?`"

Step 4:
Replace EN with HI: "Korbin asked - `Whats up दूध (dude) ?`"

Step 5:
Output: "The cow asked - `Whats up दूध (dude) ?`"
